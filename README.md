# Probabilistic-full-program-induction
This is the implementation of the full program induction technique extended to probabilistic programs.
To run verify.py, first set up Vajra on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS by following the instructions on this link: https://github.com/divyeshunadkat/VAJRA.git
Once you are inside the same directory as the Vajra executable file, run verify.py by providing the filename as an argument, such as "python verify.py tests/<test_name>". It will either return success, failure, or unknown.
You can also run "python run_all.py" to run all tests one by one and save the outputs in the file 'results.json'.
